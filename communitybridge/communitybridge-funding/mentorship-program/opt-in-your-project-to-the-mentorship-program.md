While applying for funding or when you edit a project, the project application form lets you opt in to the Mentorship program and allocate funds for it. After your project is approved, it is available in:

* [CommunityBridge Mentorship](https://people.communitybridge.org/) for Mentorship program participants
* [CommunityBridge Funding](https://funding.communitybridge.org/) for individuals and organizations to donate, and for individuals to apply as a mentee
