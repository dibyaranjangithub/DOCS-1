# Travel Scholarships

You can learn about Travel Scholarships and donate to the ones you would like to support. Travel Scholarships provide financial assistance to need-based individuals for travel expenses such as travel to a Linux Foundation conference or an open source project-related technical summit. Each detail pages shows high-level information about the overall funding, including how funds are distributed and what the funding goals are. CommunityBridge Funding also maintains and displays a transparent ledger of incoming funds \(backer and sponsor transactions\) and outgoing funds \(developer invoices, expenses paid, and so on\) for each Travel Scholarship. The Financial tab lists all these transactions with details so that the entire community can view receipts of expenses.
