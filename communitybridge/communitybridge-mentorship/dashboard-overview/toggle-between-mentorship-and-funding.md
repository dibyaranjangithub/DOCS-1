# Toggle Between Mentorship and Funding

Your project is available in CommunityBridge Mentorship _and_ in CommunityBridge Funding for the following purposes:

* **To Raise and Allocate Funds** You use CommunityBridge Funding to raise and allocate funds for projects including projects that participate in the Mentorship program. Contributors, beneficiaries, and mentees use the Funding reimbursement process to submit reimbursement requests and claims for stipends. These payments are recorded in Funding and are visible in the project details.
* **To Manage Mentorships** You use CommunityBridge Mentorship to offer and manage learning opportunities for aspiring open source software contributors. Mentors are matched with mentees who have the specific skills your project is looking for. The number or mentorships that your project can offer per term and the stipend amounts that you pay depend on Mentorship program fund allocation.

You can toggle between projects in Mentorship and Funding at any time, offering you a quick way to go to the same project details or the same projects list in either service. For example, from Mentorship go to Funding to view stipend payments listed in the Financial tab of your project.

**Do these steps:**

1. Go to project details or a project list.
2. Click **Funding** or **Mentorship** depending on what service you are in:
   * From Mentorship, click **Funding**: ![](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/download/thumbnails/7418697/Funding-Toggle.png?version=1&modificationDate=1574933176395&api=v2)
