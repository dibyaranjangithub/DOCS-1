# Dashboard Overview

CommunityBridge Mentorship makes it easy for individuals and companies to get involved in mentorship programs. Mentorship matchmaking can help individual mentees grow as a contributor to open source communities. The program connects Mentorship program applicants with projects; mentees with mentors; projects with donors to provide mentorship stipends; and mentorship graduates with interview opportunities.
