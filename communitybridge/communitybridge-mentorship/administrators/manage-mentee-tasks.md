# Manage Mentee Tasks

A mentee applicant must have at least one application task to complete, for example an interview. When you enroll your project in Mentorship program, you select or define prerequisites that a mentee applicant must completeâ€”these tasks appear in the Tasks view. This view lets you add and edit new tasks and update their statuses.
