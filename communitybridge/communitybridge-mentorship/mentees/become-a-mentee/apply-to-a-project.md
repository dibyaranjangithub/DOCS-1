# Apply to a Project

As a mentee, you can get the opportunity to engage in an open source project under the guidance of someone experienced in the project and community. If you want to learn/develop a new skill or want to learn open source projects, you can submit a mentee application for a project that you are interested in.

**Follow these steps:**

1.  [Log in](../../../user-profile/log-in-to-communitybridge/) to [CommunityBridge Mentorship](https://people.dev.platform.linuxfoundation.org/).
2. Click **Become a Mentee** on the top menu.

* If you have a profile, projects that match your skills appear:

    3. Select a project of interest and then click **Apply**.

* For projects that your application is declined or you have withdrawn your application, you can re-apply to those in next term.
{% endhint %}

Depending on the project, an **Almost There!** message informs you that may have to complete various tasks before you will be eligible for consideration to be matched with a mentor. These tasks can help you see if you like working on the project and also demonstrate to the project administrator and mentor that you can excel as a mentee.

You receive an email from CommunityBridge Team informing you that your application is received.  

* After you apply, your application is in **Pending** state until the project admin or mentor changes the status of your application. For details, see [View Status of your Application](../view-status-of-your-application.md)
* You must complete the tasks that are assigned to you to graduate from Mentorship program.
