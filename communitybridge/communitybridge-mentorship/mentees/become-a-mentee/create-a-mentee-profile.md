# Create a Mentee Profile

You can create a profile so that Mentorship participants \(project administrators, mentors, and companies\) can see information about you and your skills. Some of the information in your profile is only available to Linux Foundation administration.

* An image file for your avatar in JPG, PNG, SVG format with a maximum size of 2 MB
