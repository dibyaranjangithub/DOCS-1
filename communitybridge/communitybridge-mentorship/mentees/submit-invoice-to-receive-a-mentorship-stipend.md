# Submit Invoice to Receive a Mentorship Stipend

Mentees are required to submit their invoices for mentorship stipends through Expensify before the Mentorship Program administrator approves the invoice. 

All stipend payments appear in the project's public ledger \(transaction list\), which allows for full transparency and lets anyone see how the mentorship funds are spent.

Consider the following financial aspects of reimbursement before you make a request:

* CommunityBridge Funding uses Expensify, a third-party expense management and payment application. Expensify is an online service application that lets you link your reimbursement account and generate expense reports. After an expense report or invoice is reimbursed through that application, it is synchronized with CommunityBridge to provide full transparency.

Have these items handy before you begin:

* Receipts for the expenses that you want to submit for reimbursement
* The Expensify policy invitation email that you received from CommunityBridge

## Submit an Expense Report: <a id="GetReimbursed-SubmitanExpenseReport:"></a>

1. Follow the [Expensify procedures](https://docs.expensify.com/en/articles/2921-report-actions-create-submit-and-close) for creating and submitting an expense report. After you submit your report, the approver receives an email notification that your report requires attention. The approver reviews your reimbursement request and approves or rejects it. Next, a Linux Foundation administrator validates the expense and approves or rejects the reimbursement. Expensify funds your account.
2.  Upon approval notification, go to your account to access your reimbursement money. It may take up to 30 business days for the funds to be deposited to your bank account.\*

\*Wire Transfer recipients will get the funds deposited to their account directly from Linux Foundation.
