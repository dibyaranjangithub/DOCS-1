# Mentee Task Management

As a mentee, you receive task assignments from your mentor. When your mentor approves the completion of all your tasks, you graduate.

Your mentorship is intended to help you begin contributing to an open source project. Therefore, contribute all your work to the project \(such as patches, documentation, tests, and so on\) according to its open source licensing and contribution policies.

You are responsible for any expenses that you incur while participating in the mentorship. In addition, if your mentorship offers a stipend, you are responsible for all taxes on any stipend amounts that you receive.

**Do these steps:**

1. Go to your **My Account** and select **My Tasks** to view your task assignments. During your mentorship, you are free to engage in other activities or studies, but you are expected to devote sufficient time to completing your tasks. 
2. Participate in ongoing check-ins and task reviews with your mentor. Meet with your mentor as often as is necessary to discuss current tasks, goals, roadblocks, and solutions. Leverage your mentor to better understand the details of the project, how the community operates and the best practices for your contributions to be accepted. 
3. Complete all your tasks to graduate from the Mentorship program. Your mentor determines whether you have satisfactorily completed each task. If you and your mentor disagree about whether you have completed the tasks, reach out to the project administrator to discuss it. When your mentor determines that all your tasks are complete, you graduate. You are listed as a graduate for that project on CommunityBridge. If your mentorship includes a stipend and you are eligible for it, [submit a claim](../../communitybridge-funding/get-reimbursed.md) for it \(projects may have varying milestones and schedules for payments of stipends\). Also, after you graduate, your mentor may introduce you to interested employers for potential interviews.

As a graduate from the Mentorship program, you may be interested in connecting with companies that are seeking interviews for job opportunities using your skills. Companies that are associated with the project can see that you are a graduate of your mentorship. You are eligible to be contacted by these companies through CommunityBridge to discuss interview opportunities. Your mentor may also refer you to a company.

Any interactions you have with a company are strictly between you and the company, and are not part of or connected to the Mentorship program, nor do such interactions involve the Linux Foundation.
