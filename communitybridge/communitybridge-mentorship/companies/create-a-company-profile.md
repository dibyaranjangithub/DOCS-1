# Create a Company Profile

To connect your company with Mentorship program graduates, you can create a profile on CommunityBridge Mentorship. Your profile lets Mentorship participants see information about your company, such as the skills your company is interested in and employment opportunities. Some of the information in your profile is only available to Linux Foundation administration, such as the Finance Contact for your company.

Keep these items ready before you begin:

* An image file for your company logo in JPG, PNG, SVG format with a maximum size of 2 MB
* Contact information for your company's job interview individual
* A list of the skills that a job candidate should possess
* Contact information for your company's financial support individual

**Do these steps:**

1. Log in to CommunityBridge Mentorship.  
For details, see [Login to CommunityBridge](../../user-profile/log-in-to-communitybridge/).  
  
2. Click **Companies** on the top menu.  
A Company application form appears.

3. Complete the form fields.  
**Note:** Red asterisks indicate required fields. A bar at the top of the page shows your progress as you click **Next** through the form. Click any of the following links for information about fields that require explanation.

* [Company Details](create-a-company-profile.md#CreateaCompanyProfile-CompanyDetails)

* [Invites](create-a-company-profile.md#CreateaCompanyProfile-Invites)
* [Terms and Conditions](create-a-company-profile.md#CreateaCompanyProfile-TermsandConditions)

4. Read and select the check box. Click **Submit**.  
**Thank You!** page appears. **Fund Now** opens CommunityBridge Funding.  
  
5. Look for a "CommunityBridge: Employer application is pending approval." email in your Inbox.  
The email includes **View Profile** option.   
The Linux Foundation administrator reviews your application and approves or rejects it. You receive an email informing you of the status.

**Note:** You can edit the company details by navigating to **My Profile** section under your account. For details, see **Profiles** section of [Manage Your Mentorship Account](../administrators/manage-your-mentorship-account.md#profiles).
