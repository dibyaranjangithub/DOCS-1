## **Security** <a id="security"></a>

 Security shows a table that lists the top 5 projects with most vulnerabilities for foundations your company is contributing towards. Vulnerability is an issue with a specific package of a repository reported by comparing a repository's dependent packages with vulnerability databases.

This table lists:

* project names
* number of issues based on severity level, such as high, medium, and low
* total number of fixable issues
* number of repositories of the project that are scanned, and
* last scanned date.

As a company, it's your responsibility to fix the issues at the earliest for projects to create a more secure code and to avoid getting hacked.
