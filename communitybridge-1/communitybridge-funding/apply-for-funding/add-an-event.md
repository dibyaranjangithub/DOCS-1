# Add an Event

As an event organizer, you can submit an application to add an Event fund to CommunityBridge Funding. For example, add an Event fund to pay for registration expenses for attendees at a women's technical meetup. In the application, invite people \(beneficiaries\) who you would like to attend or participate in the event and then be reimbursed for their related expenses. These beneficiaries will receive an invitation from Expensify \(an expense management application\) so that they can submit reimbursements for their expenses.
