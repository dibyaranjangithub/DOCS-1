# How to Be a Mentor

You can become a mentor by:

* [Creating](../../mentors/become-a-mentor/create-a-mentor-profile.md) a profile on the CommunityBridge [website](https://people.communitybridge.org/participate/mentor), and
* [Accepting](../../mentors/become-a-mentor/accept-to-be-a-mentor-from-an-email-invitation.md) the invitation from the project administrator. 

As a project maintainer, you can also [add/enroll](../../administrators/enroll-your-project/) a project to participate in the mentorship program
