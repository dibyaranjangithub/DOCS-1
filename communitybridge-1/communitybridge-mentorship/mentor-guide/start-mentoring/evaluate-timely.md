# Evaluate Timely

Evaluations are conducted three or four times on a regular basis. These are the opportunities for you to evaluate your mentee on their progress. Depending on projects, you will have a 1:1 check-in virtual meetings with mentees.  After you complete the mentee evaluation, submit evaluation reports to program managers. Based on satisfactory evaluation reports, stipends will be released for mentees. This evaluation report is official, however, you should provide timely regular feedback to mentees during meetings, and over communication channels so that mentees have sufficient time to correct themselves, if they are weak in some areas, for future evaluations. 

**Note:** Mentees are also asked to share their experience, provide feedback and suggestion at the end of the program so that Linux Foundation can make improvements for future programs. Keep in mind that your mentoring during the program is reflected in their blogs.

### How do Evaluations Work:

Linux Foundation does a survey by publishing questions for mentors. These questions focus on the following objectives:

* How active mentees are in the community
* If  mentees are attending all the scheduled meetings
* If mentees are completing all the assigned tasks, and so on. 

After mentors submit evaluation reports, mentees will be informed about their progress/performance based on project guidelines.
