# View Mentee Profile

After a mentee applies to your project, you can view their profile before you accept or decline their application.

To view mentee profile:

1. Go to your account and click **My Projects** from the drop-down list.  ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/my-projects.png)

3. Under Mentees tab, click ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/profile-icon.png) ****to view a mentee's profile.

By-default, **Public** tab appears which shows the projects and mentors that the mentee is associated with. You can navigate to **Applications** and **Tasks** tabs to see and manage application status and tasks assigned to the mentee.
