# Create a Mentor Profile

You can create a mentor profile and apply for the project/projects that you are interested in. After you submit an application, the respective project administrator reviews your profile and if your skills match the project requirement, the project administrator sends you an email inviting you to become a mentor for the particular project. You can [accept the invitation](accept-to-be-a-mentor-from-an-email-invitation.md) to become a mentor.

Keep these items ready before you begin:

* Your LinkedIn profile web address
* Your GitHub profile web address
* Your resume in a PDF, DOC, or DOCX format
* An image file for your avatar in JPG, PNG, SVG format with a maximum size of 2 MB
