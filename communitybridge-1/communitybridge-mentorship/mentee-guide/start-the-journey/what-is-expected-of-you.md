# What is Expected of You

To successfully graduate from this mentorship program, you need to be focused, and actively engage with the community during the entire program. Like you, there are many other candidates participating in this program from across the globe who might have different native language, culture, and some other. Be professional with your communication when you ask or post anything in the communication channel. Not just that, you need to be specific while asking questions to your mentors. Apart from these, following are some points to keep in mind:

**Communicate:** Keeping the line of communication open between you and your mentor\(s\) will build trust, respect, and a positive relationship that facilitates the successful completion of the project.

* Schedule weekly check-ins to review progress, blockers, and upcoming tasks.
* Clarify communication channels/norms with your mentor\(s\), project team, and broader community: email, chat, calls, wiki, and etc.
* Be aware of communication challenges across time zones and language/cultural differences. Be on time for scheduled meetings and be respectful of your mentor’s time \(remember your mentors are volunteers\).
* Don’t be afraid to ask questions, be upfront about gaps in skill and knowledge.
* Inform your mentor\(s\) of vacation or breaks in advance and plans to make up for lost days.

**Connect:** Gaining a broader understanding of the community, industry, and potential career paths can help generate new ideas and make you a more effective and long-term contributing member of the community.

* Take the initiative to network with other professionals beyond your immediate team that you come in contact with either remotely or F2F at hackfest, meetup, bootcamp, or conferences and so on.
* Use project mailing list to reach out to and connect with the current cohort of peer mentors.
* Explore projects and understand how the community is organized, for example Working Groups and Special Interest Groups, and how you may be able to participate or contribute.
* Attend/organize a project meetup in your local community or on your campus.

**‌ Document:** Documenting your progress, agreed-on project plan, weekly goals/tasks, milestones, changes/modifications helps keep yourself on track and others you work with on the same page.

* Develop a project plan at the start of the program and refine/revist/document changes as things progress
* Maintain a log to track your progress and consider using the log as the basis of discussions during your weekly check-ins with mentor\(s\)
* Work on project documentations as part of deliverables so that code can be used by others and to continue the development momentum

Blog about your mentorship experiences: At the end of the program, you are requested to write a blog about your mentorship experience, and take help from project admins to publish your blog. 

**Attend conferences:** By attending conferences, you will get an opportunity to know and communicate in-person with all the members of the community. There is a lot to learn in conferences  in the context of social gathering, interpersonal skills, communication, and many more.  Connect with community and prospective employers: You are not here just to graduate. What’s the use if you don’t utilize your graduation achievement. This platform provides an opportunity for you to get hired as well by the potential employers, and this needs your proactiveness. Talk to your community on a regular basis, be active on the conversational channels, share your feedback, ask questions, and showcase your progress and talent to the entire community that draws employers’ attention.
