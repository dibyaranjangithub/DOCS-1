# How to Apply

**Step 1: Review Eligibility**

The Mentorship Program aims at providing a structured and guided learning opportunity for  people with necessary skills to help them become contributors to open source projects. We also welcome Mentees enrolled in accredited higher education institutions across the globe to apply \(some restrictions may apply\). Please first review the [eligibility requirements](am-i-eligible.md) to determine if you're eligible to apply.

**Step 2: Create LFID**

An LFID helps us to identify an application easily. Creating an LFID is also beneficial for you to raise any request or concern during your mentorship program. You can also connect your social media accounts with your LFID, to showcase your achievements in open source software development. You can create Linux Foundation ID \(LFID\), as described [here](../../user-account/create-a-linux-foundation-account.md). 

**Step 3: Prepare Application Material**

Besides collecting standard demographic and contact information on the application, we will ask you to upload the following documents:

* Resume
* Cover letter in which you are recommended to answer the following questions:
  * How did you find out about our mentorship program?
  * Why are you interested in the project\(s\) you are applying to?
  * What experience and knowledge/skills do you have that are applicable to the requirements of the project\(s\) you're applying to?
  * What do you hope to get out of this experience?
* Proof of enrollment \(only for college/university students\) — college transcript, or a scan of Mentee ID, or letter of admissions offer for those who are graduating from high school.

Make sure to have these materials ready before you proceed to submit your application. We are looking for qualified applicants who are passionate about becoming active contributors and future leaders in the open source software projects through this mentorship experience.

**Step 4: Create Mentee Profile**

By creating a mentee profile, you actually upload a profile with all the necessary information on Linux Foundation database. So, when you apply for multiple projects, you don’t have to provide information each time you apply for multiple projects; with a single click, you will be able to apply to multiple projects. Go to [CommunityBridge](https://people.communitybridge.org/), and create a mentee profile as described [here](../mentees/become-a-mentee/create-a-mentee-profile.md).

**Step 5: Discover Mentorship Project**

The Linux Foundation mentorship projects are listed on the CommunityBridge website with detailed descriptions about each project, such as what the project is all about, required skills, terms,associated companies providing opportunities, mentor details, and so on. The project descriptions, learning objectives and outcomes, and any additional information or links on the project page will give you insight which mentorship is the best fit for you. Lastly, some mentorships require full-time commitment while others will allow both full-time and part-time mentees. Make sure the program timetable fits into your schedule.   
**Note:** you can apply to maximum three \(3\) mentorship programs in one term.

**Step 6: Submit Application and Get Selected**

CommunityBridge is the portal where the mentorship projects are listed and you can apply with a single click on the Apply button.

Congratulations! You have successfully applied to the Mentorship program. Now what? Your application will be reviewed and project admin will contact you with the next steps.
