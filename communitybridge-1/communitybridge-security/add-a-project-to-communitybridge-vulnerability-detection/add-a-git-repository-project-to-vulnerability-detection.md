# Add a Git Repository Project to Vulnerability Detection

As a project maintainer, you submit an application to add a Git Repository project to CommunityBridge Vulnerability Detection.

Have these items handy before you begin, although they are not required:

* The URL for your code of conduct \(the rules of behavior for the members of that group or organization\).
* A logo file that represents your project in JPG, PNG, SVG format with a maximum size of 2 MB.
* A list of names and email addresses of individuals who are authorized to view the details of your project's scans.

**Do these steps:**

1. Log in to CommunityBridge Vulnerability Detection.
2. Click **Apply**. "Ready to solve your funding, security and growth challenges?" appears.
3. Select **Sign up with git Repository**. A project application form appears that lets you provide information about your project.
4. Complete the form fields. Red asterisks indicate required fields. A bar at the top of the page shows your progress as you click **Next** through the form. See [Project Application Form](../../communitybridge-funding/project-application-form.md) for information about fields that require explanation.
5. Click **Submit Application**. The Linux Foundation administrator approves or rejects the application.
6. \(Optional\) Go to your user account ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/7419011.png) and select **My Projects** to see your pending project.
