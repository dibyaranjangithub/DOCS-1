# Add a GitHub Project to Vulnerability Detection

As a project maintainer, you submit an application to add a GitHub open source project to CommunityBridge Vulnerability Detection. Vulnerability Detection requires access to your code repository to support security vulnerability scanning. The application process requires you to authenticate your GitHub ID to grant Vulnerability Detection read-only access to the repositories you maintain.

Have these items handy before you begin:

* The URL for your code of conduct \(the rules of behavior for the members of that group or organization\).
* A logo file that represents your project in JPG, PNG, SVG format with a maximum size of 2 MB.
* A list of names and email addresses of individuals who are authorized to view the details of your project's scans.

**Do these steps:**

1. Log in to CommunityBridge Vulnerability Detection.
2. Click **Apply**. "Ready to solve your funding, security and growth challenges?" appears.
3. Select **Sign up with GitHub**.
4. Enter your credentials and click **Sign in**. Your administrator permissions to the projects on GitHub are validated. ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/7419009.png)
5. Click **Authorize LF-Engineering** to grant CommunityBridge Vulnerability Detection read-only access to your GitHub account. The Select Repository dialog appears. This dialog lets you link a repository to your project. Access to your code repository is required to support security vulnerability scanning by CommunityBridge Vulnerability Detection. ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/7419006.png)
6. Select the **repository** that you want to use and click **Next**. \(Click the dots to see more repositories.\) This step verifies that you have the correct organization and repository selected for your CommunityBridge Vulnerability Detection project. You cannot change your selection after you submit your application.  A project application form appears that lets you provide information about your project. ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/7419005.png)
7. Complete the form fields. Red asterisks indicate required fields. A bar at the top of the page shows your progress as you click **Next** through the form. See [Project Application Form](../../communitybridge-funding/project-application-form.md) for information about fields that require explanation.
