# Get License Information

CommunityBridge Security identifies the licenses that are used by your projects and their dependencies.

**Do these steps:**

1. Select **Licenses** from the top menu.

   All licenses are listed in alphabetical order for the dependencies in a project by their license identifier, for example, `Apache-2.0`. The list also shows the number of dependencies for each license. Dependencies with more than one license are shown individually.

2. Click a license **identifier** to go to the SPDX License and find out more information about a license. The SPDX License includes a full name, standardized short identifier, vetted license text, and other information about the license.
3. Click **Export as CSV** to export the data to a Comma-Separated Values \(CSV\) file, which you can open, save, or both. Here is an example snippet of an exported CSV file from the Licenses tab:  


   | **name** | **dependencyCount** |
   | :--- | :--- |
   | **Apache-2.0** | 16 |
   | **BSD-2-Clause** | 16 |
   | **BSD-3-Clause** | 17 |
   | **CC0-1.0** | 1 |
