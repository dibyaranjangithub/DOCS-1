**Jenkin Overview** shows the number of servers, jobs, and builds  for a project.

**Jenkin Builds** shows the total number of builds for a particular week by date. Mouse over a color to see the total number of builds for a week by date.

**Jenkins - Avg. Build Duration Over Time Per Job** shows the time in minutes for the total number of jobs per day over time and a trend line to show an increase, decrease, or stability in the job time.

**Jenkin Summary** shows a table that lets you sort values by Job Name, Total Builds, Last Build, and Last Build Timestamp.

**Jenkin Results** shows a doughnut chart that represents the total number of builds in the project by status: SUCCESS, FAILURE, UNSTABLE, ABORTED. Mouse over a color in the chart to see the status, total number of builds for the status, and the percentage of the project's builds for that status.

## Jenkins &gt; Jobs  <a id="Jenkins-Jenkins&gt;Jobs"></a>

SUMMARY: Jobs shows data about Jenkins jobs such as duration, successes, and failures over time.

**Jenkins\_jobs\_result** shows the number of success count, failure count, aborted count, and unstable count of builds.

**Jenkin Results** shows a doughnut chart that represents the total number of jobs in the project by status: SUCCESS, FAILURE, UNSTABLE, ABORTED. Mouse over a color in the chart to see the status, total number of jobs for the status, and the percentage of the project's jobs for that status.

**Jenkins\_jobs\_builds\_chart** shows a bar graph that represents the number of jobs per day over time.

**Jenkins - Avg. Build Duration Over Time Per Job** shows the time in minutes for the total number of jobs per day over time and a trend line to show an increase, decrease, or stability in the job time.

**Jenkins\_jobs\_simple\_summary** shows a table that lets you sort values by Job Name, Builds, URL, and Last Build.

## Jenkins &gt; Nodes <a id="Jenkins-Jenkins&gt;Nodes"></a>

SUMMARY: Nodes shows an overview of Jenkins build and job data over time.

**Summary** shows the number of builds, jobs, nodes, and average build duration in minutes.

**Results** shows a doughnut chart that represents the total number of builds in the project by status: SUCCESS, FAILURE, UNSTABLE, ABORTED. Mouse over a color in the chart to see the status, total number of builds for the status, and the percentage of the project's builds for that status.

**Jobs** shows a bar graph that represents the total number of job per day over a timeline.

**Duration Trend** shows the time in minutes for the total number of jobs per day over time and a trend line to show an increase, decrease, or stability in the job time.

**Success/Failures in percentage** shows a bar graph with each value as a percentage of the total count of jobs per day over time. Mouse over Success or Failures to show the corresponding data in the graph.

**Nodes** show a table of nodes, which are machines that are part of your Jenkins environment. For each node, the table shows the node name, number of builds on the node, the 50th percentile of builds duration in minutes, and builds duration in minutes.
