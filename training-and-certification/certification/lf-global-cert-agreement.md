## 2. Confidentiality and Intellectual Property Ownership <a id="2-confidentiality-and-intellectual-property-ownership"></a>

### 2.1 Confidentiality <a id="2-1-confidentiality"></a>

LF makes exams available to you solely to test your knowledge of the exam subject matter for which you seek Certification. You are expressly prohibited from disclosing, publishing, reproducing, or transmitting any exam and any related information including, without limitation, questions, answers, worksheets, computations, drawings, diagrams, length or number of exam segments or questions, or any communication, including oral communication, regarding or related to the exam \(known collectively as “Confidential Information”\), in whole or in part, in any form or by any means, oral or written, electronic or mechanical, for any purpose.

Confidential Information includes the contents of the exam, which may not be disclosed as set forth above, including to any employee not affiliated with the LF Certification Program. A disclosure of Confidential Information by any means in violation of this Agreement undermines the integrity and security of the Program.

Certification is based upon a candidate meeting the minimum requirements of the Program, including achieving passing scores on required examinations in accordance with LF’s testing guidelines. If you meet these requirements you will receive a certificate from LF signifying your accomplishment. If Certification expires \(see [Section 3.2]()\), then the candidate must retake the examination and again achieve passing scores to renew the Certification.

Certification is only available for natural persons, not corporations or other legal entities. Should the candidate misuse any certificate or Marks associated with any of the Certification schemes, appropriate action will be taken to resolve the case and prevent recurrence. Serious and/or continuous misuse will give rise to Certifications being withdrawn and legal action being taken as appropriate. \(Use of Marks is defined in [Section 3.6]().\)

### **3.2 Certification Period** <a id="certification-period"></a>

Certifications expire 36 months from the date that the Program certification requirements are met by a candidate. Candidates must meet Certification renewal requirements prior to the expiration date of their certification in order to maintain active certification.

If any LF Certification requirements are modified, this Agreement and your LF Certification may be terminated by LF without further notice, unless you adhere to any applicable LF Certification requirements.

### **3.4 Certification Revocation** <a id="3-4-certification-revocation"></a>
